# Introduction
This is one of my games. I'm always happy to spend my free time for game development. Also this is my first Unity 3D expirience, especially in 2D.


# Gameplay
Classic tetris gameplay: bricks and walls. You need to move and rotate falling bricks, with the aim of creating a horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any brick above the deleted line will fall.
