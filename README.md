# Introduction
This is one of games implemented by myself. I'm always glad to spend my free time for playing games and game development activities. Also this is my first Unity expirience, especially in 2D.

This project is complete. Game was optimized and tested for Windows and Android platforms. Code is shared as a part of knowledge transfer.

# Gameplay
Classic tetris gameplay: bricks and walls. You need to move and rotate falling bricks, with the aim of creating a horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any brick above the deleted line will fall down.
